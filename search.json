    "text": "Motivation\nWhile advances in modern morphometrics (landmarks configuration and outline analysis) have increasingly facilitated data acquisition and analysis, traditional morphometrics has not kept pace. Collection of traditional morphometric data from fish images is generally slow and not reproducible. A typical workflow in ImageJ is:\n\nOpen an image.\nAdjust the image if necessary (or do this beforehand with another software).\nDraw reference lines to help with trait measurement (Optional).\nMeasure traits one by one.\nSave results.\nClose the image (losing track of the work done).\nOpen the next image and repeat the procedure.\n\nAdditionally, traits are often defined and measured differently by different researchers as a standardised protocol does not exist yet, making it impractical to merge data obtained from multiple studies.",

The image is duplicated and all the following steps will be performed on the duplicated image to avoid any unwanted modification of the raw image. The ROI Manager window is automatically opened and the first dialog box appears, to either set the scale or adjust the image, depending on the type of analysis selected.\nThe steps required to perform the selected analysis are explained in:\n\nChapter 5: Main Traits\nChapter 6: Head Angles\nChapter 7: Gut Traits\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Multiple Images\n\nNew analysis\nBefore starting to analyse an image database the new project should have a clear folder structure. MorFishJ does not require a fixed folder structure, but only an input directory where the raw images are stored and two output directories, one to save the Regions Of Interest (ROIs) and one to save the results and log files (although the same output directory could be used for all outputs). Therefore, you can set your own folder structure. However, it is advisable that each project has its own directory with the following structure.\n./ProjectName/\n├── raw_images\n│   ├── img1.JPG\n│   ├── img2.JPG\n│   ├── img3.JPG\n│   └── ...\n├── results\n└── ROIs\nThere are three subdirectories: one containing the raw images, one to save the ROIs and processed images, and one to save the results and log files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nDo NOT use the same directory as both input and output! This would prompt an error when trying to continue the analysis loading the TraitLog file.\n\n\nTo start a new analysis click on the Multiple Images...New button of the desired analysis. The following dialog box appears.\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the Browse button to add the path to the input directory where the raw images are stored, and the output directories where the ROIs and results will be saved. Alternatively, it is possible to drag the directories over the dialog box. By default the results file will be named Traits and will be saved in .csv format, but it is possible to change both the name and the extension, which can be changed to .txt through the drop-down list.\nOnce all the fields are completed click OK. Two files are created in the selected directory for the results:\n\na log file with the name TraitLog followed by the date of creation in dd_mm_yyyy format and including all the metadata required to restore the project.\na results file with the selected name and extension. Results are appended to this file at the completion of the analysis of each image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nDo not edit the TraitLog file by hand and do not change its directory!\n\n\nThe first image in the input directory is automatically opened and duplicated, and the following dialog box appears. All the next steps will be performed on the duplicated image to avoid any unwanted modification of the raw image.\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect Skip image to skip the current image if it is not needed or is of poor quality and move directly to the next one. Optionally, add any observations to the current image in the Remarks field. These will be saved in the results under the column “remark”. This dialog appears every time a new image is opened.\nThe steps required to perform the selected analysis are explained in:\n\nChapter 5: Main Traits\nChapter 6: Head Angles\nChapter 7: Gut Traits\n\n\n\nContinued analysis\nIt is possible to stop and restart each analysis without losing progress. Everything done until the last completed image is saved, thus, if the analysis is stopped before completing an image, only the steps performed on that image are lost.\nTo continue a project from where it was last left, click on the Continued Analysis button of the desired analysis. The following dialog box appears.\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the Browse button or drag the file over the dialog box to add the path to the TraitLog file of the project. Thus click OK. The project is restored and can be continued from the next image. The new results will be appended to the existing results file.\n\n\n\n\nBellwood, D. R., C. H. R. Goatley, S. J. Brandl, and O.
