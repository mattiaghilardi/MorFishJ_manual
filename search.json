    "text": "Status of the manual\n\n\n\nHi there! This manual is a work-in-progress.\n\n\nMorFishJ is an open-source software package for traditional morphometric analysis of fish from side view images in ImageJ. With MorFishJ you can collect morphological trait data from fish images in a standardised and reproducible way through a semi-automated procedure, which accelerates data collection and increases data accuracy by reducing user bias.\n\n\nWhile advances in modern morphometrics (landmarks configuration and outline analysis) have increasingly facilitated data acquisition and analysis, traditional morphometrics has not kept pace. Collection of traditional morphometric data from fish images is generally slow and not reproducible. A typical workflow in ImageJ is:\n\nOpen an image.\nAdjust the image if necessary (or do this beforehand with another software).\nDraw reference lines to help with trait measurement (Optional).\nMeasure traits one by one.\nSave results.\nClose the image (losing track of the work done).\nOpen the next image and repeat the procedure.\n\nAdditionally, traits are often defined and measured differently by different researchers as a standardised protocol does not exist yet, making it impractical to merge data obtained from multiple studies.\n\n\n\nMorFishJ allows users to perform a complete morphometric characterisation in a limited time while recording and storing all steps, and saving results in a ready-to-use format suitable for statistical analysis with multiple software. Analyses of large photographic databases are facilitated by allowing users to stop and restart their analyses without losing progress.\n\n\n\nThis manual is a step-by-step user guide to MorFishJ. It explains best practices for project organisation, walks through each implemented analysis, and provides detailed explanations and examples for specific steps."

    "text": "Therefore, the installation of ImageJ (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html) or Fiji (https://imagej.net/software/fiji/downloads) is required before installing MorFishJ.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nMorFishJ depends on ImageJ 1.53e, thus, if ImageJ/Fiji was previously installed, first check the current ImageJ version below the toolbar. If it is older than 1.53e, to update ImageJ click Help –> Update ImageJ…, choose the latest version and click OK. Then ImageJ/Fiji must be restarted.\n\n\nOnce ImageJ/Fiji is installed/updated, proceed with installing MorFishJ following these steps:\n\nDownload MorFishJ:\n\nfor people familiar with GitHub: clone or download the entire GitHub repository;\n\nfor people not familiar with GitHub: click here to go to the project’s main page on GitHub, click on the green button Code, then click on Download ZIP, thus extract the content.\n\n\nCopy the MorFishJ v0.0.1 folder in the ImageJ/plugins/ or Fiji.app/plugins/ directory.\n\nNow MorFishJ is installed. Open ImageJ/FIJI and click Plugins –> MorFishJ v0.0.1 –> MorFishJ GUI. The following GUI appears in the upper left corner of the screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIn Fiji the Plugins menu is often crowded, thus it may be easier to use the Search field under the toolbar to find and start MorFishJ."

    "text": "2.2 Single and multiple image analysis\nEach analysis have three different buttons:\n\nSingle Image: to analyse only one image (may be useful for beginners to get used to each step before analysing the entire image database).\nMultiple Images…New: to start a new analysis of an image database.\nContinued Analysis: to continue analysing an image database from where it was last left.\n\n\n2.2.1 Single Image\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nAn image must be opened before starting a single image analysis.\n\n\nClicking on the Single Image button of the desired analysis before opening an image will display the following message.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo open an image click on File –> Open… or use the shortcut Ctrl+O or drag the image over the ImageJ GUI.\nOnce the image is opened click on the Single Image button of the desired analysis. The image is duplicated and all the following steps will be performed on the duplicated image to avoid any unwanted modification of the raw image. The ROI Manager window is automatically opened and the first dialog box appears, to either set the scale or adjust the image, depending on the type of analysis selected.\nThe steps required to perform the selected analysis are explained in the following chapters.\n\n\n2.2.2 Multiple Images\n\nNew analysis\nBefore starting to analyse an image database the new project should have a clear folder structure. MorFishJ does not require a fixed folder structure, but only an input directory where the raw images are stored and two output directories, one to save the ROIs and one to save the results and log files (although the same output directory could be used for all outputs). Therefore, you can set your own folder structure. However, it is advisable that each project has its own directory with the following structure.\n./ProjectName/\n├── raw_images\n│   ├── img1.JPG\n│   ├── img2.JPG\n│   ├── img3.JPG\n│   └── ...\n├── results\n└── ROIs\nThere are three subdirectories: one containing the raw images, one to save the ROIs and processed images, and one to save the results and log files.\nTo start a new analysis click on the Multiple Images...New button of the desired analysis. The following dialog box appears.\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the Browse button to add the path to the input directory where the raw images are stored, and the output directories where the ROIs and results will be saved. Alternatively, it is possible to drag the directories over the dialog box. By default the results file will be named Traits and will be saved in .csv format, but it is possible to change both the name and the extension, which can be changed to .txt through the drop down list.\nOnce all the fields are completed click OK. Two files are created in the selected directory for the results:\n\na log file with the name TraitLog followed by the date of creation and including all the metadata required to restore the project.\na results file with the selected name and extension. Results are appended to this file at the completion of the analysis of each image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nDo not edit the TraitLog file by hand and do not change its directory!\n\n\nThe first image in the input directory is automatically opened and duplicated. All the following steps will be performed on the duplicated image to avoid any unwanted modification of the raw image. The ROI Manager window is automatically opened and the first dialog box appears, to either set the scale or adjust the image, depending on the type of analysis selected.\nThe steps required to perform the selected analysis are explained in the following chapters.\n\n\nContinued analysis\nTo continue a project from where it was last left, click on the Continued Analysis button of the desired analysis. The following dialog box appears.\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the Browse button or drag the file over the dialog box to add the path to the TraitLog file of the project. Thus click OK. The project is restored and can be continued from the next image. The new results will be appended to the existing results file.\n\n\n\n\nBellwood, D. R., C. H. R. Goatley, S. J. Brandl, and O.
