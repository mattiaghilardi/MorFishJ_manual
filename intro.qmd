# Installation

[ImageJ](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) is an open source image processing program commonly used by researchers to extract morphometric data from fish images. As such, `MorFishJ` has been developed as an extension of this software and it can be used in both ImageJ 1.x and Fiji (ImageJ2) distribution.

Therefore, the installation of ImageJ (<https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html>) or Fiji (<https://imagej.net/software/fiji/downloads>) is required before installing `MorFishJ`.

::: {.callout-warning}
`MorFishJ` depends on `ImageJ 1.53e`, thus, if ImageJ/Fiji was previously installed, first check the current ImageJ version below the toolbar. If it is older than 1.53e, to update ImageJ click **Help --\> Update ImageJ...**, choose the latest version and click OK. Then ImageJ/Fiji must be restarted.
:::

Once ImageJ/Fiji is installed/updated, proceed with installing `MorFishJ` following these steps:

1.  Download `MorFishJ`:
    -   for people familiar with GitHub: clone or download the entire [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mattiaghilardi/MorFishJ);\
    -   for people not familiar with GitHub: [click here](https://github.com/mattiaghilardi/MorFishJ) to go to the project's main page on GitHub, click on the green button `Code` and then click on `Download ZIP`.\
2.  Extract the content.
3.  Copy the `MorFishJ v0.0.1` folder in the `ImageJ/plugins/` or `Fiji.app/plugins/` directory.

Now `MorFishJ` is installed. Open ImageJ/FIJI and click **Plugins --\> MorFishJ v0.0.1 --\> MorFishJ GUI**. The following GUI appears in the upper left corner of the screen.

::: {.callout-tip}
In Fiji the Plugins menu is often crowded, thus it may be easier to use the `Search` field under the toolbar to find and start `MorFishJ`.
