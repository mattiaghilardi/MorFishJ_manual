# Gut Traits {#sec-gut_traits}

The `Gut Traits` analysis allows to measure three intestinal traits related to fish diet (@tbl-gut-def).

| Code | Trait            | Description                                                                                                                                    | Reference     |
|----------------|----------------|-------------------------|----------------|
| GL   | Gut length       | Length of the intestine from the pyloric outlet to the anus in fishes with a stomach, or from the oesophagus to the anus in stomachless fishes | @Ghilardi2021 |
| GD   | Gut diameter     | External diameter of the intestine (average of 10 measurements: GD1-GD10)                                                                                | @Ghilardi2021 |
| GS   | Gut surface area | External surface area of the intestine calculated as GL x 2$\pi$(GD/2)                                                                         | @Ghilardi2021 |

## Analysis

Once the steps described in @sec-setup are completed the screen will be populated with a number of windows:

- the ImageJ/Fiji main window
- the MorFishJ GUI
- a fish image (this is a duplicate of the raw image to prevent any modification)
- the ROI manager
- the `Set scale` dialog

This analysis has a few steps that require the user input:

1. Set the scale for the image as described in [Chapter -@sec-set_scale].

2. Trace a segmented line following the midline of the intestine as shown below.

After clicking `OK` 10 points appear equally distributed along this line.

3. At the level of the point closest to the oesophagus, trace a straight line perpendicular to the midline traced in the previous step and joining the two margins of the intestine.

4. Repeat step 3 for each point in order moving towards the anus. See example below.

The analysis of the image is completed. In case of single image analysis a window named `Traits` containing all the results appears. This can be saved by clicking on `File -> Save As...`. All ROIs in the ROI manager can also be saved as a zip file by clicking on `More >>> -> Save...`. In case of multiple image analysis a new row will be added to the results file and the ROIs are saved in their directory. The current image is closed and the next is opened. Repeat steps 1-4 for all images.

## Results

The results file/table contains one row for each image and 16 columns. The first column, `image_id`, is the name of the image without extension. The second column, `px.cm`, is the scale of the image in pixels/cm. The columns 3-5 are the traits described in [@tbl-gut-def] in *cm* (*cm^2^* for GS). The columns 6-15 are the 10 raw measurements of the diameter (GD1-GD10) in order from the oesophagous to the anus. The last column, `time`, is the time spent to analyse the image (steps 1-4) in seconds.
