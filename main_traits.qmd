# Main Traits

The `Main Traits` analysis is the workhorse of `MorFishJ` as it performs a complete morphometric characterisation of fishes. It requires the user input to trace the outline of the body and pectoral fin, and to position some reference lines ([@tbl-ref-lines]) and landmark points. The coordinates of these lines and points allow to extract 22 morphometric measurements described in [@tbl-traits-def].

## Analysis

Once the steps described in @sec-setup are completed the screen will be populated with a number of windows:

- the ImageJ/Fiji main window
- the MorFishJ GUI
- a fish image (this is a duplicate of the raw image to prevent any modification)
- the ROI manager
- the `Set scale` dialog

While the majority of the analysis is automated, there are a number of steps that require the user input:

1. Set the scale for the image as described in [Chapter -@sec-set_scale].

2. Adjust the image if necessary as described in [Chapter -@sec-straighten_rotate].

3. Select the orientation of the fish (i.e., whether the fish is facing left or right) from a drop-down list. This step is important for the correct automatic placement of some reference lines and points.

![](images/screenshots/orientation.png){width="30%" fig-align="center" fig-alt="Fish orientation"}

4. Select the fish outline following the instruction in the dialog. Trace a polygon around the body and caudal fin, excluding the dorsal, pelvic, and anal fins as in the example below. Also avoid including any portion of pectoral fin protruding from the body area. Once the selection is completed it can be adjusted as needed.

::: {.callout-tip}
The points that define the selection can be moved. To add a new point to the selection press `Shift` and click on an existing point. To remove one point press `Alt` and click on the point. See [Polygon Selection Tool](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/guide/146-19.html).

5. Position reference line A at the narrowest point of the caudal peduncle. After clicking `OK` several automatic steps will split the outline in two, the body area (Bs) and caudal fin area (CFs), and add reference lines B-G.

6. Position reference line H at the base of the caudal fin to mark the end of the standard length.

7. Position reference line I at the posterior margin of the operculum.

![](images/screenshots/ref_lineI.png){width="80%" fig-align="center" fig-alt="Example of reference line I"}

8. Trace an ellipse around the eye as in the example below (see [Elliptical Selection Tool](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/guide/146-19.html) for specific instructions on how to use this tool). After clicking `OK` two new reference lines (J-K) are drawn perpendicular intersecting at the eye centroid.

![](images/screenshots/eye_ellipse.png){width="80%" fig-align="center" fig-alt="Example of ellipse around the eye"}

9. Place a point at the insertion of the pectoral fin as in the example below.

![](images/screenshots/pectoral_fin_insertion.png){width="80%" fig-align="center" fig-alt="Example of point at the pectoral fin insertion"}

After clicking `OK` reference line L appears passing through the selected point and 14 new traits are drawn and added to the ROI manager together with all reference lines.

10. Select the outline of the pectoral fin as in the example below. After clicking `OK` this is saved in the ROI manager as PFs.

![](images/screenshots/pectoral_fin_outline.png){width="80%" fig-align="center" fig-alt="Example of pectoral fin outline"}

11. Trace a line on the longest ray of the pectoral fin. After clicking `OK` this is saved in the ROI manager as PFl.

![](images/screenshots/pectoral_fin_length.png){width="80%" fig-align="center" fig-alt="Example of pectoral fin length"}

12. Place a point at the tip of the premaxilla (upper jaw) as in the example below. After clicking `OK` a new trait (Mo) is drawn and saved in the ROI manager.

![](images/screenshots/tip_upper_jaw.png){width="80%" fig-align="center" fig-alt="Example of point at the tip of upper jaw"}

13. Place a point at the corner of the mouth. 

::: {.callout-important}
The point should be placed at the intersection between the maxilla and the lower jaw ([fish skull anatomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_jaw#/media/File:FishKeyDay.jpg)), not where the flesh of the upper and lower jaw meet! See the example below.

:::

After clicking `OK` the last three traits are drawn and saved in the ROI manager.

The analysis of the image is completed. In case of single image analysis a window named `Traits` containing all the results appears. This can be saved by clicking on `File -> Save As...`. All ROIs in the ROI manager can also be saved as a zip file by clicking on `More >>> -> Save...`. In case of multiple image analysis a new raw will be added to the results file, the ROIs are saved in their directory, where also the rotated or straightened images are saved as `.jpg` files. The current image is closed and the next is opened. Repeat steps 1-13 for all images. 

It is possible to stop and restart the analyses (see @sec-setup) without losing progress. Everything done until the last completed image is saved, thus, if the analysis is stopped before completing an image, only the steps performed on that image are lost. 

## Results

The results file/table contains one row for each image and 25 columns. The first column, `image_id`, is the name of the image without extension. The second column, `px.cm`, is the scale of the image in pixels/cm. The columns 3-24 are the morphometric measurements described in [@tbl-traits-def]. Currently, all linear measurements are in centimetres and all areas in squared centimetres. The last column, `time`, is the time spent to analyse the image (steps 1-13) in seconds.
