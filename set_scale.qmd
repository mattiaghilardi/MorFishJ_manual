# Set scale {#sec-set_scale}

Two analyses, `Main Traits` and `Gut Traits`, require to set the scale for the image. This is the first step of both analyses. The following dialog box appears.

![](images/screenshots/set_scale_info.png){width="30%" fig-align="center" fig-alt="Set scale instructions"}

Trace a straight line on a reference object and click `OK`.

::: {.callout-tip}
The reference object can also be the fish itself if its length (standard, fork, or total) is known. In this case trace a line over the fish to select the appropriate length.

The following dialog box appears.

![](images/screenshots/set_scale_dialog.png){width="40%" fig-align="center" fig-alt="Set scale dialog"}

Enter the known length of the traced line and select the unit from the drop-down list. Three options are available (*mm*, *cm*, and *inch*), but any unit will then be converted to *cm*. Thus all linear measurements will be saved in *cm* and areas in *cm^2^*.

The traced line will be stored in the ROI Manager as `px.cm` and then saved with all other ROIs. A column `px.cm` will also be included in the results file indicating the scale of the images in pixels/cm. 

::: {.callout-warning}
At the moment it is not possible to run the `Main Traits` and ` Gut Traits` analyses on images without a reference object or known fish length as setting the scale is required. However, in the upcoming update setting the scale will become optional and all images can be analysed.
