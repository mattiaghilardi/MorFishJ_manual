# Image scale {#sec-image_scale}

The first step of the `Main Traits` and `Gut Traits` analyses is to set the scale for the image. While for the `Main Traits` analysis this is optional, it is required for the `Gut Traits` analysis.

## Main Traits scale

When starting the `Main Traits` analysis the following dialog box appears.

![](images/screenshots/image_scale.png){width="40%" fig-align="center" fig-alt="Image scale dialog"}

There are three options:

- Add a scale through a reference object in the image.
- Add a scale through the known length of the fish.
- Do not add a scale to the image.

Check the box of the appropriate option to add a scale, or leave the boxes empty and click `OK` to continue without adding a scale. If both options are selected, a reference object will be used.

### Scale through reference object {-}

After selecting `Reference object` the following dialog box appears.

![](images/screenshots/reference_scale_info.png){width="30%" fig-align="center" fig-alt="Reference scale instructions"}

Trace a straight line on a reference object and click `OK`. The next dialog box appears.

![](images/screenshots/reference_scale_dialog.png){width="40%" fig-align="center" fig-alt="Reference scale dialog"}

Enter the known length of the traced line and select the unit from the drop-down list. Three options are available (*mm*, *cm*, and *inch*), but any unit will then be converted to *cm*. The traced line will be stored in the ROI Manager as `px.cm` and then saved with all other ROIs. The scale of the image, in *pixels/cm*, will be saved in the results file within the column `px.cm` to allow converting the results, which are saved in *pixels*, to *cm*, if preferred.

### Scale through fish length {-}

After selecting `Known fish length` the following dialog box appears.

![](images/screenshots/known_length.png){width="40%" fig-align="center" fig-alt="Known fish length dialog"}

Enter the known length of the fish, select the unit from the drop-down list, and select the type of length, either `standard length` or `total length`, from the drop-down list. As for the reference object, the scale of the image, in *pixels/cm*, will be saved in the results file within the column `px.cm` to allow converting the results, which are saved in *pixels*, to *cm*, if preferred.

## Gut Traits scale

The procedure to add a scale to the `Gut Traits` analysis is the same as using a reference scale in the `Main Traits` analysis.

When starting the `Gut Traits` analysis the following dialog box appears.

![](images/screenshots/set_scale_info.png){width="30%" fig-align="center" fig-alt="Set scale instructions"}

Trace a straight line on a reference object and click `OK`.

::: {.callout-tip}
For the `Gut Traits` analysis the reference object could also be the fish itself if it is in the image and its length (standard, fork, or total) is known. In this case trace a line over the fish to select the appropriate length.

The following dialog box appears.

![](images/screenshots/set_scale_dialog.png){width="40%" fig-align="center" fig-alt="Set scale dialog"}

Enter the known length of the traced line and select the unit from the drop-down list. Three options are available (*mm*, *cm*, and *inch*), but any unit will then be converted to *cm*. The traced line will be stored in the ROI Manager as `px.cm` and then saved with all other ROIs. The scale of the image, in *pixels/cm*, will be saved in the results file within the column `px.cm` to allow converting the results, which are saved in *cm*, to the original *pixels*, if preferred.
