# Head Angles {#sec-head_angles}

The `Head Angles` analysis allows to extract three angles (@fig-head-angles, @tbl-angles-def) related to vision and feeding [@Brandl2013; @Bellwood2014; @Brandl2015] from the coordinates of some reference lines and points (@fig-angles-ref-lines, @tbl-angles-ref-lines).

: Description of reference lines and points traced on fish images for head angles analysis {#tbl-angles-ref-lines}
:::
[^1]: The user needs to trace an ellipse around the eye and lines L1-L4 can be automatically drawn from the coordinates of this selection.

## Analysis

Once the steps described in @sec-setup are completed the screen will be populated with a number of windows:

- the ImageJ/Fiji main window
- the MorFishJ GUI
- a fish image (this is a duplicate of the raw image to prevent any modification)
- the ROI manager
- the `Image adjustment` dialog

This analysis has six steps that require the user input:

1. Adjust the image if necessary as described in [Chapter -@sec-straighten_rotate].

2. Select the orientation of the fish (i.e., whether the fish is facing left or right) from a drop-down list. This step is important for the correct automatic placement of the reference lines.

![](images/screenshots/orientation.png){width="30%" fig-align="center" fig-alt="Fish orientation"}

3. Place a point at the tip of the premaxilla (upper jaw) as shown below. After clicking `OK` this is saved in the ROI manager as P1.

![](images/screenshots/tip_upper_jaw_head.png){width="80%" fig-align="center" fig-alt="Example of point at the tip of upper jaw"}


4. Trace an ellipse around the eye as shown below (see [Elliptical Selection Tool](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/guide/146-19.html) for specific instructions on how to use this tool). After clicking `OK` five reference lines (L1-L5) are drawn.

![](images/screenshots/eye_ellipse_head.png){width="80%" fig-align="center" fig-alt="Example of ellipse around the eye"}

5. Place a point at the intersection between line L5 and the dorsal margin of the snout as shown below. After clicking `OK` the first angle (Ha) is drawn and saved in the ROI manager.

![](images/screenshots/upper_L5_head.png){width="80%" fig-align="center" fig-alt="Example of intersection between L5 and dorsal of snout"}

6. Place a point at the intersection between line L5 and the ventral margin of the snout as shown below. After clicking `OK` the other two angles (Sa, EMa) are drawn and saved in the ROI manager.

![](images/screenshots/lower_L5_head.png){width="80%" fig-align="center" fig-alt="Example of intersection between L5 and ventral of snout"}

The analysis of the image is completed. In case of single image analysis a window named `Traits` containing all the results appears. This can be saved by clicking on `File -> Save As...`. All ROIs in the ROI manager can also be saved as a zip file by clicking on `More >>> -> Save...`. In case of multiple image analysis a new row will be added to the results file, the ROIs are saved in their directory, where also the rotated or straightened images are saved as `.jpg` files. The current image is closed and the next is opened. Repeat steps 1-6 for all images. 

## Results

The results file/table contains one row for each image and 5 columns. The first column, `image_id`, is the name of the image without extension. The columns 2-4 are the angles described in [@tbl-angles-def] in degrees. The last column, `time`, is the time spent to analyse the image (steps 1-6) in seconds.
