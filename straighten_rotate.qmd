# Straighten and rotate {#sec-straighten_rotate}

Two analyses, `Main Traits` and `Head Angles`, require the fish to be in a straight and horizontal position. For such analyses the software allows to adjust the image if required. For the `Main Traits` analysis this is the second step, after adding the scale as described in [Chapter -@sec-image_scale], whereas for the `Head Angles` analysis it is the first step. The following dialog box appears.

It allows to select one of two options:

-   `Straighten`: to straighten the fish if it is in a bent position.
-   `Rotate`: to rotate the image and set the fish in an horizontal position.

Therefore, if the fish is not straight and horizontal, select the appropriate option and click `OK`. Otherwise, click `OK` without selecting any option and continue.

## Straighten {-}

When the fish is bent, select `Straighten` and click `OK`. The following dialog box appears together with the `Line Width` window.

![](images/screenshots/line_width.png){width="35%" fig-align="center" fig-alt="Line Width window"}

Follow the instructions given in the dialog box, create a segmented line selection, increase the line width until the whole fish falls within the shaded area and click `OK`. The fish will be straightened and in an horizontal position. The following figure shows an example of fish straightening.

::: {.callout-tip}
Selecting `Spline fit` within the `Line Width` window can improve the selection and straightening of the fish.
:::

::: {.callout-warning}
If the fish is overly bent, straightening can lead to deformation of the body which affects the measurement of the traits. Use this option with care.
:::

## Rotate {-}

When the fish is straight but not horizontal, select `Rotate` and click `OK`. The following dialog box appears.

![](images/screenshots/rotate_dialog.png){width="70%" fig-align="center" fig-alt="Dialog for image rotation"}

Follow the instructions given in the dialog box, trace a line and click `OK`. The image will be rotated and, if the line was placed well, the fish will be in an horizontal position. The following figure shows an example of image rotation.
